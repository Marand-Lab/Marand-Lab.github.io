# Available Positions

## Postdoctoral
We are looking for highly motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in studying the function of *cis*-regulatory elements, transcriptional regulation, chromatin biology, and development. Ideal applicants should be well-versed in at least two of the following research areas: (epi)genomics/bioinformatics/computational biology, plant molecular biology/biochemistry/genetics, or plant developmental biology.

## Graduate
Interested graduate students should apply to the [MCDB PhD program](https://lsa.umich.edu/mcdb/graduate-students/phd-program.html) or [Bioinformatics PhD program](https://medschool.umich.edu/departments/computational-medicine-bioinformatics/education/phd-program), directly. Students admitted to one of these UM PhD programs interested in studying *cis*-regulatory, transcriptional, and developmental variation using high-throughput genomic, computational and molecular biology approaches should contact Alex Marand for more details.

## Undergraduate
We are happy to train eager students seeking laboratory research experience in a myriad of genetic, molecular biology, computational biology and plant biology techniques. Undergraduates in their Freshman and Sophomore years are encouraged to apply through the UROP mechanism. More details on UROP can be found [here](https://lsa.umich.edu/urop).

Interested applicants can contact us [here](/contact.md).
