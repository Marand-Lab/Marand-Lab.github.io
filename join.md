# Available Positions

## Postdoctoral
The lab is always looking for highly motivated postdoctoral fellows who are interested in studying the function of *cis*-regulatory elements, transcriptional regulation, chromatin biology, and development. Ideal applicants should be well-versed in at least two of the following research areas: bioinformatics/computational biology, (epi)genomics, molecular biology/biochemistry, plant genetics, population genetics, cell biology, or developmental biology.

## Graduate
Graduate students should apply to the [MCDB PhD program](https://lsa.umich.edu/mcdb/graduate-students/phd-program.html) directly. After applying, students interested in studying *cis*-regulatory variation using high-throughput genomic, computational and molecular biology approaches should contact Alex Marand for more details.

## Undergraduate
We are happy to train eager students seeking laboratory research experience in a myriad of genetic, molecular biology, computational biology and plant biology techniques.

Interested applicants can contact us [here](/contact.md).
