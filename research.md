How can a single cell develop into a multicellular organism composed of millions, billions, and even trillions of cells? The lab is broadly interested in understanding how (epi)genetic and (epi)genomic variation affects cis-regulatory activity and transcription regulation. Assigning .</p>

I was afforded a tremendous amount of scientific independence throughout my doctoral dissertation in the Jiang lab at UW-Madison. The focus of my initial project aimed to characterize the fine-scale genetic architecture of yield in diploid potatoes. At the time, population genotyping via skim sequencing – although in its infancy – was becoming recognized for its power in studies of quantitative trait loci. As a junior PhD student armed with sequencing data from a segregating heterotic population and an insatiable appetite for literature, I realized that the potential of these data sets was not limited to linkage mapping; they could reveal meiotic crossover breakpoints at high-resolution. Encouraged by the work of geneticists studying meiosis in humans, I became fascinated by the molecular framework governing recombination in plants. My interest in recombination – initially geared towards elucidating the chromatin and sequence determinants of meiotic crossovers – began to take on a more theoretical and evolutionary perspective, leading to the question of how recombination may influence patterns of divergence in closely related species. Now as a postdoc, I am focused on elucidating how variation in cis-regulatory elements, chromatin structure and patterns of transcription encourage phenotypic evolution. I envision my future research program will bridge these past and current interests, facilitating a more basic understanding of the molecular and evolutionary implications provided by recombination.</p>

Crop domestication is a fascinating and important area of study, defined by questions regarding the origins of crops, how they were modified to their present state, and where and when these processes took place. A deeper understanding of these events has direct implications for plant improvement by identifying the extent of genetic diversity, which traits are under quantitative vs. qualitative genetic control, and ultimately which forms of selection are most likely to result in genetic gains. I am currently investigating the demographic history (i.e. changes in population size and population structure) and influence of human selection in <i>Brassica oleracea</i> using genomic data. I love <i>B. oleracea</i> as a system to study domestication as it is a classical example of crop domestication and phenotypic plasticity, with selection acting on different organs to produce crops such as kale, cabbage, kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts. The major questions I hope to answer are: (1) How has selection influenced genome-wide levels of genetic diversity?, (2) Has selection for enrichment of specific plant organs affected metabolite composition, specifically amino acid and glucosinolate content?, and (3) How is this variation controlled at the whole-genome level (i.e. how many genes are contributing and how are they positioned in the genome)?
