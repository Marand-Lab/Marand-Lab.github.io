###**Motivation**

<p align="justify">
The long term goal of the lab is to understand how the genome of a single cell encodes the development of an entire multicellular organism composed of millions, billions, and even trillions of cells. Cellular diversity within and between organisms is largely attributed to differences in transcriptional variation, with cis-regulatory elements - sequences that control when and where a gene is transcribed - playing a major role. To tackle this question, the lab is currently focused on three major objectives:

> The first major objective is to identify and functionally characterize the comprehensive catalog of cis-regulatory elements in plant genomes. Leveraging recent advances in single-cell profiling methods, the lab primarily focuses these efforts in _Zea mays_ and Arabidopsis thaliana_ and aims to expand to other crop and model plant systems.

> Second,

> Third, the lab is interested in understanding how (epi)genetic and (epi)genomic variation affects cis-regulatory activity and transcription regulation at the molecular and mechanistic levels. Coupling standing genetic variation and mutagenesis approaches with high-throughput sequencing and reporter assays at the single-cell level facilitates characterization of novel molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity in cellular function, identity, and development.  </p>
